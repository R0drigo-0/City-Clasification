# City Classification
This project aims to create a program that given a region of a map as an input, will output the city that it belongs to.

## Cities
- Barcelona
- Berlin
- Budapest
- London
- Madrid
- Paris
- Riga
- Stockholm
- Tallinn
- Zagreb

## TODO
- [x] First version of the classifier using Template Matching (only supports cropped regions of the same map?)
- [ ] Second version using SIFT (or similar technique) (works with rotated, scaled images)
- [ ] Final version using deep learning
